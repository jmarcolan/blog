# Implementing a Perceptron in PyTorch: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction
The perceptron is the simplest form of a neural network and serves as the building block for more complex architectures. It was introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in the 1950s and is primarily used for binary classification tasks. The perceptron learns by updating its weights based on the weighted sum of inputs and an activation function, which determines the output. In this guide, we will implement a basic perceptron with PyTorch and test it on the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in machine learning.

## Step 1: Import Libraries
Start by importing the necessary libraries, including PyTorch and libraries for data handling and visualization.

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import torchvision.transforms as transforms
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset
```

## Step 2: Prepare the Dataset
We will use the Iris dataset for this example, which includes three classes of iris plants and four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. We'll convert the dataset into a format that can be used by PyTorch.

```python
# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Converting target for binary classification (0 or 1)
y = (y == 0).astype(int)  # Taking class '0' as positive class

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Convert to PyTorch tensors
X_train_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(X_train)
X_test_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(X_test)
y_train_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(y_train).view(-1, 1)
y_test_tensor = torch.FloatTensor(y_test).view(-1, 1)

# Create DataLoader
train_data = TensorDataset(X_train_tensor, y_train_tensor)
train_loader = DataLoader(dataset=train_data, batch_size=16, shuffle=True)
```

## Step 3: Define the Perceptron Model
The perceptron consists of a single linear layer followed by a sigmoid activation function to produce binary class probabilities.

```python
class Perceptron(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size):
        super(Perceptron, self).__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(input_size, 1)  # One output for binary classification

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.sigmoid(self.linear(x))
```

## Step 4: Train the Perceptron
To train the perceptron, we’ll define the loss function and optimizer. We will use binary cross-entropy loss and stochastic gradient descent (SGD).

```python
model = Perceptron(input_size=4)  # 4 features in the Iris dataset
criterion = nn.BCELoss()  # Binary Cross-Entropy Loss
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

num_epochs = 100
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for inputs, labels in train_loader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()  # Zero the gradient buffers
        outputs = model(inputs)  # Forward pass
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)  # Compute the loss
        loss.backward()  # Backpropagation
        optimizer.step()  # Optimize the weights

    if (epoch+1) % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch [{epoch+1}/{num_epochs}], Loss: {loss.item():.4f}')
```

## Step 5: Evaluate the Model
After training, we evaluate the model on the test dataset.

```python
with torch.no_grad():  # No need to track gradients while evaluating
    test_outputs = model(X_test_tensor)
    predicted = (test_outputs >= 0.5).float()
    accuracy = (predicted.eq(y_test_tensor)).sum().item() / y_test_tensor.size(0)
    print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}')
```

## Proposed Graphs
1. **Loss Curve:** Plot the training loss against epochs to visualize how the model learns over time.
2. **Accuracy Plot:** A graph showing accuracy on the training and validation sets over epochs.

## Proposed Tables
- **Results Table:** Summarize model performance on the test data, listing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Proposed Images
- **Architecture Diagram:** Display a schematic representation of the perceptron showing inputs, weighted connections, and output.
- **Data Visualization:** Plot the Iris dataset features with decision boundaries defined by the trained model.

## Summary
In conclusion, we successfully implemented a basic perceptron using PyTorch and tested it on the Iris dataset. Through this process, we demonstrated how to load and preprocess the dataset, define the neural network architecture, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
